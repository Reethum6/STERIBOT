PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
With advancing technology and lifestyle changes, medical waste is increasing, risking disease transmission and worker injury. Current waste management methods are expensive and challenging to maintain. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these issues, emphasizing the need for efficient and affordable solutions. Discovering new diseases adds complexity to waste management. Ensuring worker safety is crucial amidst rising medical waste. Managing biomedical waste while controlling costs is essential. We face a pressing challenge in balancing waste disposal effectiveness with affordability. Simplifying waste management processes can mitigate risks and costs. Innovations are needed to address the growing volume of medical waste. A comprehensive approach is required to tackle the evolving landscape of biomedical waste management. 
APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM: 
Our approach to the project involves the development of a semi-autonomous robot controlled via an HC-05 Bluetooth module. Path monitoring is facilitated using an ESP32 CAM module, which also detects obstacles. The robot is equipped with an arm-like structure at its front, enabling it to collect waste with a tray and deposit it into a dustbin. The dustbin is divided into metal and non-metal sections by a sheet located at its rear. An inductive proximity sensor integrated into the tray determines whether the waste is metallic. Subsequently, an algorithm directs a servo motor to position the dustbin accordingly, allowing metal waste to be deposited into the designated section. Ultrasonic sensors assess whether the dustbin is full, with a buzzer indicating its status. Upon waste collection, the robot is controlled via Bluetooth to transport it to a designated sterilization or disinfection area. At this location, planks or sheets are deployed to prevent waste spillage during the process. Positioned atop an inclined plane on the chassis, the dustbin facilitates the separation of waste into two distinct trays for subsequent sterilization and disposal procedures.
